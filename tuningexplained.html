    <h2>Gearing</h2>
    <p>
      Gearing: When choosing the proper gearing and wheel speed for a track, you
      want to find the balance between wheel speed and grip. You want to have
      enough wheel speed to maintain drift and angle around the entirety of the
      track while also not having so much wheel speed that you're slower due to
      the tires spinning faster than the tire grip can hold or cause you to be
      slower than your competitors. TL:DR: Too little wheel speed will cause you
      to struggle to keep angle and line, too much can cause you to be slower
      and also easier to go wide off the ideal line for the track you are
      running.
    </p>
    <h2>Tires</h2>
    <p>
      Tires: When choosing the proper tire psi to run, refer to the tire app
      in-game when you take your mouse all the way to the right side of the
      screen and have your in-game applications show up. Select tires and choose
      the psi that shows up green in the "psi" section of the tire app. This is
      preference. Tire psi can make your car feel sluggish and lacking grip,
      finding the optimal tire psi is recommended when setting a car up for a
      competition. For normal tandems, choose a psi that feels good.
    </p>
    <h2>Electronics</h2>
    <p>
      Electronics: 1. Turbo pressure: 100% turbo isn't always the best choice to
      go with when setting a car up for a competition. Sometimes turning the
      turbo psi down can make it easier to drive a track and also faster
      depending on the situation and track configuration. 
      2. Traction control:
      Never have traction control turned on when drifting. Traction control
      stops the slip of the tires to maintain as much grip as possible. TC is
      not your friend in a drift car. 
      3. ABS: Anti lock brakes can be beneficial
      but can also hinder you when setting up a drift car. If you are one who
      enjoys driving with a bunch of grip then maybe ABS is for you. If you like
      the front tires to slip a little then having ABS off and allowing the
      tires to lock up is your best option. Typically ABS is turned off on a
      drift car.
    </p>
    <h2>Alignment</h2>
    <p>
      Alignment is the angle at which your tires sit, camber controls the pitch
      of your tires from top to bottom and toe controls if the tires point
      inward or outward from the from of the tire to the back of the tire. Drift
      setups can range from next to no camber up to -8 degrees of camber for the
      front tires. Most setups are around -4.5 to -5.5 for the front camber.
      Most setups run no camber in the rear or just enough for the tire to be at
      0 camber when the car is under power to accumulate for the anti squat or
      squat. Some cars rears lift under power and some cars squat. To check
      this, go to the suspension app while in game and launch the car to see if
      the rear end squats or lifts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toe adjustments can be crucial for a proper setup. A good go to is .2 all
      around. Just as camber, you want negative toe for the front and positive
      for the rear. So for a general base we recommend starting around -0.2 toe
      in the front and 0.2 in the rear. This will allow your car to have a
      little bit more angle for the front tires, as for the rear positive toe
      gives the car more driving force forward (forward bite) too much toe in
      the rear can cause the tire to lose side grip (side bite). Play around to
      see what works best for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dampers: The damping of a car is exactly what it sounds like. Bump, Fast
      bump, rebound and fast rebound. Bump is how reactive your car is to bumps.
      (Lower for a softer response and higher for a more active response)
      Rebound is the downward driving force on your tires through your
      suspension. Higher rebound pushes harder into the ground where as lower
      rebound will be more sluggish to react to the tire returning to the
      surface of the road after hitting a bump. Typically on a drift car you
      want the suspension to be soft but also remain active enough to keep the
      tires on the asphalt when hitting bumps and dips in the road. Dampening
      can also help with maintaining angle. Some cars have a tendency to over
      rotate when thrown to lock, to eliminate some of this, increase your front
      toe upwards to around -0.3, -0.3 being the most amount of negative toe you
      want to add, anything more negative than -0.3 can cause the car to be
      unpredictable. You can also combat this by increasing your front fast
      rebound a bit. To add self steer to the car and also help with force
      feedback you can increase the fast rebound in the front. Dampers play a
      big role in a proper setup. A lot of it is preference on how you like the
      car to feel. Play around with them to see what suites you best.
    </p>
    <h2>Drivetrain</h2>
    <p>
      Drivetrain: Drivetrain is one of the things not played with too much.
      Usually the go to would be a locked diff which would be 100% for both the
      acceleration and the deceleration. This however can also be adjusted to
      have more control of your car. Some people run as low as 60%/40%.
      Drivetrain is also a preference, we recommend starting at 100%/100% with
      no preload.
    </p>
    <h2>Brake Bias</h2>
    <p>
      Brake Bias : Brake bias is easy to get right. Most drift cars have
      somewhere between 67%-70%. Brake pressure is drivers choice. If you like
      to slam the brakes then maybe lowering the pressure a bit could help. If
      youâ€™re soft footed on the brakes then we recommend staying at 100%
      pressure.
    </p>
    <h2>Suspension</h2>
    <p>
      Suspension: Wheel rate is the stiffness of your springs. Higher rates
      make the car stiffer and lower makes the car softer. Most cars are set up
      soft and the rear and stiff in the front. Ride height is preference but
      can also effect the way the car feels. We recommend having the car sit
      level or as close to level as you can get it with the exception being that
      if you choose to rake the car then to rake towards the rear. Meaning the
      rear slightly lower than the front.
